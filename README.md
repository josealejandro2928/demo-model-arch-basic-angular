# Basic Reference Architecture Modeler
This app allows users to create Reference Architecture in a vanilla way. Also, you can instantiate this RA with a Software Architecture that complains with the chosen RA. The system implements an engine validation that suggests to the users the action for reaching compliance.

## Definitions and concepts

**Software Architecture (SA)** refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.

**Reference Architecture (RA)**, in essence, can be defined as a general architecture used as a foundation for the design of concrete architectures within a given context or application domain, e.g., automotive, banking, the internet of things, avionics, and robotics.
A RA is a generic architecture that provides guidelines and options for making decisions in developing more specific architectures.

## Gallery
The user can create a new Reference Architecture and a Software Architecture.
Or simple can see the predefined list of designs and start to work using some design as a baseline.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
